DOCUMENTATION
Modify this program so that whatever your website is, this program sends the request to that website instead of the example website given here. Also make sure to add the actual target website URL. This program blocks the IP address of the victim (not the website owner, the computer owner) for an hour and send 99 requests towards your second victim (the website owner), all while taking the resources of targeting only one victim. Study the code and the Google API limits to make it clearer
