DOCUMENTATION
When you run this program, it will ask you how requests does it need to spam to the target website. This will be asked by this question- "How many times?". Write a numerical int command which should not exceed 99 if you intend to use this as a DOS attacker and have not modified this program. This is because Google API limit mentions that a program cannot spam more than 99 requests or else the attacking computer's IP address will be blocked, now if you intend to use this as a ransomware virus you can easily shut off the victim's IP address using this shenanigan. If you are a DOS attacker, then there are many ways to bypass these limits, including using proxy servers. That's why if you want to test your servers on DOS attacks or test your antivirus on viruses, then it is highly recommended to modify it according to your needs.
